## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for building the app based on the provided requirements and constraints. The plan is broken into **main tasks** and **technical considerations** for each phase.

---

### **Project Plan**

#### **1. Project Setup**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up version control (e.g., GitHub repository).
  2. Create project structure (backend, frontend, NFT generation).
  3. Install dependencies for Python (backend) and React (frontend).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `pip` for Python packages (e.g., Flask, Solana SDK).
  - Use `npm`/`yarn` for React dependencies.
  - Ensure compatibility with Solana blockchain tools.

---

#### **2. Backend Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up Solana SDK integration:
     - Handle CRAFT token transactions (e.g., `spl-token` library).
     - Verify and process payments of 100 CRAFT.
  2. Create database schema:
     - Store transaction details (e.g., user wallet address, NFT ID, timestamp).
     - Track NFT ownership.
  3. Develop APIs:
     - `/purchase-nft`: Handle NFT purchase requests.
     - `/get-nft`: Retrieve NFT data (web, email, SVG) for users.
  4. Generate NFT metadata:
     - Create unique NFT metadata (e.g., name, description).
     - Link metadata to SVG images.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use Flask/Django for API development.
  - Use SQLite/PostgreSQL for the database.
  - Ensure secure handling of Solana private keys and transactions.

---

#### **3. Frontend Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up React app:
     - Create a responsive and intuitive UI.
     - Integrate Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solana Wallet Adapter).
  2. Develop NFT browsing and purchase flow:
     - Display available NFTs.
     - Allow users to sign transactions for purchasing NFTs.
  3. Display purchased NFT details:
     - Show access links for web, email, and SVG image.
  4. Implement wallet connection:
     - Allow users to connect their Solana wallet.
     - Display wallet balance (CRAFT tokens).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use React hooks for state management.
  - Test wallet integration thoroughly.
  - Ensure responsive design (mobile and desktop).

---

#### **4. NFT Generation**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop script to generate SVG images:
     - Use Python libraries (e.g., `svgwrite`) for SVG creation.
     - Ensure visual uniqueness for each NFT.
  2. Attach metadata:
     - Generate JSON metadata files for each NFT.
     - Include name, description, and SVG link.
  3. Store NFTs:
     - Save SVG files and metadata on the backend.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Ensure SVG images are scalable and visually appealing.
  - Use secure storage (e.g., AWS S3) if necessary.

---

#### **5. Testing**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Test Solana transactions:
     - Verify payment of 100 CRAFT.
     - Check NFT ownership tracking.
  2. Test frontend-backend integration:
     - Ensure smooth API communication.
     - Verify NFT generation and delivery.
  3. Test user experience:
     - Ensure wallet integration works seamlessly.
     - Test responsiveness and UI/UX flow.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use automated testing tools (e.g., pytest for backend, Jest for frontend).
  - Conduct manual testing for edge cases.

---

#### **6. Deployment**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Deploy backend:
     - Use Flask/Django deployment tools (e.g., Gunicorn, WSGI).
     - Host on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
  2. Deploy frontend:
     - Use platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
     - Ensure HTTPS for secure communication.
  3. Set up monitoring:
     - Track API performance and errors.
     - Monitor wallet transaction success rates.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., private keys).
  - Ensure scalability for increasing user load.

### **Timeline**
1. **Week 1**: Project setup, backend Solana integration, and database schema.
2. **Week 2**: Frontend UI development and wallet integration.
3. **Week 3**: NFT generation and API development.
4. **Week 4**: Testing and debugging.
5. **Week 5**: Deployment and final testing.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. Functional web app for purchasing NFTs with CRAFT tokens.
2. Seamless wallet integration and transaction processing.
3. Visually appealing SVG NFTs with metadata.
4. Access to NFTs via web, email, and image formats.
